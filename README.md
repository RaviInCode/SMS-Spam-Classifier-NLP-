# SMS-Spam-Detection(NLP),,
### Introduction:
The SMS Spam Detection NLP Project is a machine learning project aimed at identifying spam messages in SMS communications using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project leverages text data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification algorithms to accurately classify messages as spam or legitimate.

### Key Features:
1. Text Data Preprocessing: Cleansing and tokenization of SMS messages to prepare them for analysis.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting relevant features from text data, such as word frequency, n-grams, and presence of specific keywords.
3. **Machine Learning Models**: Training and evaluation of classification algorithms, including Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and others, to classify messages as spam or non-spam.
4. **Evaluation Metrics**: Assessment of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **User Interface**: Interactive interface for users to input messages and receive real-time classification results.

### Technologies Used:
- **Python**: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK)**: Library for NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and stopword removal.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for implementing classification algorithms and evaluating model performance.
- **Flask**: Micro web framework for building the user interface and deploying the application.
- **HTML/CSS**: Frontend technologies for designing and styling the user interface.

### How to Use:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone [repo-url]`.
2. Install dependencies using pip: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Flask application: `python app.py`.
4. Access the application in your web browser: `http://localhost:5000`.
5. Enter a message in the input field and click "Classify" to see the classification result.

### Dataset:
- The project utilizes a labeled dataset of SMS messages containing both spam and non-spam messages for training and evaluation purposes.

### Project Goals:
- To develop an accurate and efficient system for detecting spam messages in SMS communications.
- To provide a user-friendly interface for users to interact with the spam detection system in real-time.
- To contribute to the field of NLP and machine learning by applying advanced techniques to real-world problems.
